# Terms of Use & EULA

Welcome to MenuBar Apps. Before you get started, please take a moment to read these Terms of Use and End User License Agreement (EULA). By using our website, apps, or any related services ("Services"), you’re agreeing to these terms. If you’re not comfortable with them, you may choose not to use the Services.

We may update these Terms from time to time, and we’ll do our best to keep you informed. If you keep using our Services after changes are posted, it means you’re cool with the new Terms.

## License for Free Software (MIT License)

Our main app, **MenuBar Tasks**, is free to use. You can download it from our website, and it’s released under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). The source code is open on GitHub, so you are welcome to use, copy, modify, merge, share, or even sell it—just follow the MIT License rules.

## License for Paid Applications (If Applicable)

If you decide to purchase one of our paid apps or features, you’ll receive a license for your use. You can install and use the app on all your Mac devices, as long as they’re yours and you’re using the same account. Your license covers the current version of the app.

Please do not share or give away your license keys. If you do, we may have to cancel your license and you could lose access to updates or support. This helps keep things fair for everyone.

## Software Delivery and Updates

You’ll receive our apps digitally—either directly from our website or through platforms like the Mac App Store. We may offer updates (sometimes free, sometimes paid), but we cannot guarantee ongoing updates, maintenance, or new features indefinitely.

## Disclaimer of Warranties

We do our best, but our Services and software come "as is" and "as available"—no guarantees or promises. We’re not making any warranties, whether express or implied (like merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement).

## Limitation of Liability

We’re not responsible for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages that might happen from using our Services or apps. For MenuBar Tasks (since it’s free), our total liability is zero. For paid apps, our liability is capped at what you paid for your license.

## Indemnification

If something goes wrong because of how you use our Services, or if you break these Terms or someone else’s rights, you agree to cover any claims, damages, costs, or legal fees that come up for MenuBar Apps, our developers, or affiliates.

## Refund Policy

Free apps do not involve any payment, so refunds do not apply. For paid apps, refunds are at the discretion of the reseller and are usually only possible if you have not used your license key (though there can be exceptions). If a trial version is available, please try it before purchasing.

## Termination

We reserve the right to suspend or end your access to our Services or revoke your license if you violate these Terms. For software under the MIT License, your rights are always governed by the MIT License itself.

## Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of Italy. If there’s ever a dispute, it’ll be handled in the courts of Italy.
