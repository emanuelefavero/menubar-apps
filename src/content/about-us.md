# About Us

Hi! I’m [Emanuele Favero](https://emanuelefavero.com), and I launched MenuBar Apps in 2025 with a simple goal: to create minimal, high-quality apps for your Mac’s MenuBar (yep, the top toolbar where your battery icon lives).

We believe in keeping things simple, focused, and enjoyable. Our first app, **MenuBar Tasks**, helps you stay organized right from your MenuBar.

And we’re just getting started! Exciting new features and additional apps are already in the works.

If you have feedback or ideas, feel free to reach out through the contact info on our website.
